"""
Q9 — Document Chunking + Embedding Pipeline [ALMOST CERTAIN]
Target time: 25 min | CoderPad-safe (Python stdlib + NumPy)

APPROACH (say this first 60 seconds):
"I'll build a three-stage RAG indexing pipeline. First, chunk_document splits text into
overlapping chunks that respect sentence boundaries. Second, a mock embedding function
using bag-of-words normalized vectors (in production: sentence-transformers). Third, a
VectorStore class that stores chunk-embedding pairs and supports top-K retrieval via
cosine similarity. Time: O(n) for chunking, O(d) for embedding per chunk, O(n*d) for
brute-force search."

CORE MATH:
- Chunking: sentence-boundary aware with overlap for context preservation
- Embedding: BoW hashed to fixed dim, L2 normalized
- Retrieval: cosine similarity = dot(a,b) / (||a|| * ||b||)

TIME: O(n) chunk, O(chunks*d) search | SPACE: O(chunks * d)
